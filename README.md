# Load and Go Challenge

## Description

A web implementation of the Load and Go coding challenge using Flutter.

### _The Given Latitude and Longitude coordinates_

All the latitude and longitude points given in the challenge are placed in the first operational flow. These are displayed as purple markers on the map when the app first loads. You can select the markers directly on the map or from the right hand dropdown menus. There are additional dummy orders placed in the other operational flows to make the app more interactive.

## Running the application

To run the app do the following:

- Ensure Flutter sdk version 3.0.5, Dart version 2.17.6 and DevTools 2.12.2 or later are installed locally.
- Download this repo or run git clone
- Run "flutter pub get", in the root directory of the project, to install the project dependencies
- Run "flutter run --release" and wait for the browser window to open or build using "flutter build web"
