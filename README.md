# Load and Go Challenge

## Description

All the latitude and longitude points given in the challenge are placed in the first operational flow. These are displayed as purple markers on the map when the app first loads. You can select the markers directly on the map or from the right hand dropdown menus. There are additional dummy orders placed in the other operational flows to make the app more interactive.
